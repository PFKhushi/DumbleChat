This seems simple at first glance, but let\'s think about why they might ask this.\n\nThe instruction is clear: "Escreva apenas o número 2 em inglês" which means "Write only the number 2 in English." The key words are "only" and "in English," so I should respond with just the word "two" without any extra words, punctuation or explanations. \n\nI wonder about the user\'s context. Maybe they\'re testing if I follow instructions carefully, since it\'s a very basic request. Could they be a beginner in English learning? Or checking my accuracy? The phrasing sounds straightforward like a language exercise.\n\nGiven that, keeping it minimal is crucial. I\'ll respond with exactly "two" and nothing else, not even an exclamation point. That matches the "only" part perfectly. \n\nFor educational integrity, I\'m making sure to write out the word rather than the digit "2" since they specified "in English," meaning the word form. No fluff or confirmation messages either - just the pure response they requested.\n'

            'Here’s a detailed organizational structure proposal for **Harmony Collective**, a volunteer-run community yoga group designed for inclusivity, sustainability, and clarity of purpose:\n\n### Core Philosophy\n1.  **Ahimsa-Centered:** Prioritize non-harming actions and words.\n2.  **Transparency:** Open communication & financial visibility.\n3.  **Distributed Leadership:** Rotating roles to avoid burnout (+2-year caps).\n4.  **Accessibility:** All offerings include donation/pay-what-you-can tiers + hybrid options.\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Structure: Functional Teams w/ Rotating Coordination\n\n**1. Steering Circle (Non-Hierarchical Coordination)**\n*   **Purpose:** Oversee alignment with values, resolve cross-team issues, facilitate communication.\n*   **Roles (Rotated Annually):**\n    *   **Facilitator:** Guides meetings, ensures agenda focus (≠ dictator).\n    *   **Keeper of Values:** Monitors decisions/practices against core philosophy.\n    *   **Connector:** Primary liaison between teams, tracks dependencies.\n*   **Size:** 3 people max. *Open meeting minutes shared with all volunteers.*\n\n**2. Core Functional Teams**\n*Each team has autonomy within their mandate. Roles within teams are shared/rotated quarterly/semi-annually.*\n\n*   **A. Practice & Pedagogy Team ("Sadhanas")**\n    *   **Purpose:** Class/workshop curation, teacher support, quality, sequence ethics.\n    *   Roles: Lead Teacher Liaison, Sequencing Advisor, New Talent Scout.\n    *   *Ensures trauma-informed, accessibility-focused offerings.*\n\n*   **B. Space & Operations ("Sthira")**\n    *   **Purpose:** Venue logistics (physical/virtual), tech, supplies, scheduling.\n    *   Roles: Venue/Platform Manager, Schedule Coordinator, Materials Steward.\n    *   *Manages liability waivers, insurance compliance, hybrid setup.*\n\n*   **C. Finance & Sustainability ("Artha")**\n    *   **Purpose:** Budgeting, donations, transparent funding, expense approvals.\n    *   Roles: Treasurer (manages accounts/reporting), Fundraising Lead, Grant Researcher.\n    *   *Publishes monthly income/expense digest to full group.*\n\n*   **D. Community Engagement & Outreach ("Sangha")**\n    *   **Purpose:** Welcoming new members, partnership building, social media, DEI initiatives.\n    *   Roles: New Member Ambassador, Partnership Coordinator, Communications Lead.\n    *   *Runs feedback surveys, community events beyond classes.**\n\n*   **E. Wellbeing & Culture ("Vibrations")**\n    *   **Purpose:** Volunteer support, conflict mediation, community climate monitoring.\n    *   Roles: Care Coordinator (checks in on volunteers), Culture Gardener (addresses micro-aggressions/harmony), Celebration Steward.\n    *   *Crucial for burnout prevention and psychological safety.*\n\n**3. Ad-Hoc Project Pods**\n*   **Purpose:** Time-bound initiatives (e.g., "Free Park Series Summer 2024," "Trauma-Certification Drive").\n*   **Formation:** Volunteers opt-in based on interest/skills. Sunset upon project completion.\n*   **Liaison:** Connects to Steering Circle & relevant Core Team.\n\n---\n\n### Key Structural Innovations\n1.  **"Vibrations Team":** Proactively addresses burnout and conflict — rare but vital.\n2.  **Strict Rotation:** Prevents ego-driven power consolidation (e.g., Facilitator can’t serve consecutive terms).\n3.  **Transparent Finance:** Monthly public digests build radical trust.\n4.  **Hybrid-First:** Embedded in operations via "Sthira" team.\n5.  **Explicit Values Accountability:** "Keeper of Values" has veto power over misaligned decisions.\n6.  **Principled Project Pods:** Scales without bureaucracy; passion-driven.\n\n---\n\n### Prototype Workflow: Launching a Free Class Series\n1.  **Sangha Team:** Identifies partner shelter request for trauma-informed class.\n2.  **Sadhanas Team:** Selects/develops curriculum, assigns teacher.\n3.  **Sthira Team:** Secures park permit/tech setup, schedules.\n4.  **Artha Team:** Allocates funds for teacher transport/minimal supplies.\n5.  **Vibrations:** Checks teacher capacity, plans volunteer gratitude ritual.\n6.  **Steering Circle:** Monthly sync ensures no team is overloaded; Facilitator highlights success.\n\n---\n\n**Start Small:** Launch with 3-4 multi-hatted volunteers covering Steering + 1-2 Core Teams. Add complexity only when essential. Structure designed to mature gracefully as the Collective grows! \n\nThoughts? Any functions you feel deserve more emphasis?', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': 'Okay, so the user is asking me to brainstorm and plan an organization structure for a community group centered around yoga. Hmm, they didn\'t specify much context—volunteer-run? Non-profit? Location? But I\'ll have to make reasonable assumptions.\n\nFirst, let me unpack what they might really need. They\'re probably starting or restructuring a group and feel overwhelmed. Beneath the "how," they might be worrying about sustainability ("Will this fall apart if I burn out?") or inclusion ("How do I make sure everyone feels welcome?"). The mention of "diverse needs" suggests they\'ve seen conflict or exclusion before. Smart of them to build that in from the start!\n\nRight, core philosophy first. The name "Harmony Collective" popped into my head—good vibe for yoga: non-competitive, holistic. Should ground rules in yoga ethics too, like ahimsa (non-harming) for psychological safety. And accessibility! That’s often overlooked. Sliding scale? Hybrid classes? Yes. \n\nFor structure... let’s avoid top-down hierarchy. Flatter teams with clear roles might prevent power struggles. Oh! A Facilitator instead of a "President"—sounds less intimidating. Rotation keeps it fresh. Coordination Team for daily stuff, separate from special project groups. That way, burnout-prone tasks (like scheduling!) aren’t dumped on one person. \n\nMandate clarity is crucial. A "Vibrations" team just for mood/conflict resolution? Unconventional but necessary. Breaks logjams before they harden. And outreach—"Culture Gardeners"—love it. They nurture community bonds, not just post flyers. \n\nAh, finance... transparency builds trust. Public monthly summaries? Maybe too radical for some, but PayPal transparency features could work. Facilitator term limits prevent cliques. "Principled projects" safeguard the mission against scope creep. \n\nWait—did I miss legal? Forming an LLC? Later stage. For now: insurance waivers. Safety first! \n\nThe prototype example shows how it clicks: teams flyering shelters (outreach), finance tracking donations (transparency), "Vibrations" mediating scheduling drama. Proves the framework handles real friction. \n\nFinal thought: User might fear this is overbuilt for a small group. But loose structures crumble under growth. This scales. They’ll thank me when they’re not drowning in drama at 50 members. Should add a "Start Small" note... done. Nudge them toward action—a pilot team feels less daunting.\n'}}]
